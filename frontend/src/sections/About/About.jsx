      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Sai Guru Prigeesh M</strong>, a passionate and motivated Full Stack Web Developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive web experiences. With a solid foundation in JavaScript and recent experience with TypeScript, I'm constantly learning and improving my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my proudest achievements is winning <strong>2nd place in the Inter-College Smart India Hackathon</strong> for the Best Idea, where my team and I showcased an innovative and impactful tech solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also an NCC cadet, which has helped me build strong leadership, discipline, and teamwork qualities â€” all of which I bring into my development work. I'm eager to contribute to real-world projects and collaborate with teams solving meaningful problems.
